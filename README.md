# Multi-Label Image Classification - Satellite Images of Amazon Rainforest

The problem to solve is to label each image with appropriate tags, so that the trained algorithm can help tackle deforestation and assist with environment conservation.

The sponsors Planet and SCCON require more robust algorithm for higher resolution imagery from satellites to more effectively. This will allow explanation of deforestation between natural causes and human causes.

This repository includes relevant work by Ming Li for a Kaggle Challenge sponsored by Planet.
